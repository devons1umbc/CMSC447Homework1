# CMSC447Homework1

This project has 6 files: A python file that handles the back end and uses flask for the server side of things as well as for the rendering of the web pages, and 5 web pages.

Pip dependencies include Flask, Pymongo, Requests, and Dnspython. The program also uses Sys and Json.

The web pages are stored in a folder called templates. The database server is a cloud based MongoDB server.

To run it, open your command prompt in the folder and type either "python3 SoftwareEngiHW1Py.py" or "python SoftwareEngiHW1Py.py". The program will take a few seconds to start up as it takes time to connect to MongoDB. Once running, you can connect to it by typing "http://localhost:5000/" into your browser. 

Places I gained inspiration for this project:
  Tech With Tim on YouTube when learning how to set up and use Flask: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqhxxeeTbu0 (this ties into a series on learning Flask)
  CSS on W3schools when learning the CSS on how to make a top bar for the web page: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav.asp
